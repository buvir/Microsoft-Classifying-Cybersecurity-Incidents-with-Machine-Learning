## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to classify cybersecurity incidents based on provided data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

---

## Project Flow

1. **Data Collection:** Obtain and store the dataset (CSV, possibly zipped).
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract and select relevant features.
4. **Model Training:** Train machine learning models (e.g., RandomForest, XGBoost).
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.
6. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to classify new incidents.
7. **Deployment (optional):** Deploy the model as an API or web app.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Microsoft-Classifying-Cybersecurity-Incidents-with-Machine-Learning.git
cd Microsoft-Classifying-Cybersecurity-Incidents-with-Machine-Learning
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Handling

- **Large Files:** If your dataset is too large for GitHub, upload it to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/), [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs/), or [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
- **Link the dataset** in this README:

    ```
    [Download the dataset from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/your-file-link)
    ```

- **Unzipping and Loading Data in Python:**

    ```python
    import requests, zipfile, io, pandas as pd

    url = 'https://your-download-link/file.zip'
    response = requests.get(url)
    with zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(response.content)) as z:
        with z.open('yourfile.csv') as f:
            for chunk in pd.read_csv(f, chunksize=100000):
                # process chunk
                print(chunk.head())
    ```
